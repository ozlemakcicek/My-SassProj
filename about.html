            <p>
            The story follows professional thief Assane Diop, the only son of an immigrant from Senegal who had come to France to
            seek a better life for his child. Assane's father is framed for the theft of an expensive diamond necklace by his
            employer, the wealthy and powerful Hubert Pellegrini, and hangs himself in his prison cell out of shame.

                <h6>Le Collier de la reine</h6>
                <p>
                    Assane Diop plans the theft of a high-priced diamond necklace, once owned by Marie-Antoinette, which his father Babakar
                    had been accused of stealing from the wealthy Pellegrini family 25 years earlier.

                <p>
                    Assane's best friend, antiquarian Benjamin Ferel, informs him that the queen's necklace was unlikely to ever have been
                    deconstructed after being stolen as the Pellegrini family had previously claimed.

                <h6>Le Commissaire Dumont</h6>
                <p>
                    After learning that Inspector Dumont was responsible for handling the case against his father, Assane kidnaps the
                    now-Commissioner Dumont from one of Paris' town halls and tries to force him into confessing to having framed Babakar.
                    25 years earlier, a younger Dumont figures out that Hubert Pellegrini, who had recently had the necklace's insurance
                    policy increased, masterminded its disappearance and set Babakar up to take the fall.
